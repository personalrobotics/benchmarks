\b or_benchmarks

This package provides access to benchmarks for the OpenRAVE environment.

All benchmarks can be run from a python interface.

To run collision checking benchmarks, use the following command:

<code>
rosrun or_benchmarks run_collision_benchmark.py
</code>

This will sample several poses (position and orientation) and check for collisions
between the kinbody and any object in the OpenRAVE environment.
